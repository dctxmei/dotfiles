The point files I use most are stored here.

## Common software

### Bash

I use [Bash-it][Bash-it] and only retain its most basic functions. Additional
functions are added via `.bash_it_custom` .

### i3

In fact, this should be called [i3-gaps][i3-gaps], it has more features, I have
been using it for several years, bid farewell to the huge DE.

### Polybar

I use it as a supplement to i3-gaps, which provides me with a lot of practical information.

### Rofi

I mainly use its application launcher function.

### Music Player Daemon (MPD)

I use [MPD][MPD] to manage my Music, which is very simple and comfortable.
